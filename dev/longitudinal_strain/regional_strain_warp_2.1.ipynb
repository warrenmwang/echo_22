    "Warp the entire ED frame step by step, keep our attention on the boundary that covers say only the first 30% of the boundary length in terms of the number of pucks stacked from top to bottom (there’s no such thing as infinitely thin slices of pucks in code, unless we’re just using vector magic). We calculate a strain relative to this frame and the previous frame. We do this for all the frames between this and the ED frame. Therefore, if there are n frames between ED and ES, we will have n - 1 strain values. We can take a mean value I guess of these n - 1 strain values and call that the overall regional strain value from ED - > ES for this section. \n"
